01. About Me
Hey there! üëã I'm a tech enthusiast hailing from the heart of India, Indore, where the "corn" is not just a snack but an emotion! Graduated as a Computer Engineer in 2021‚Äîmy journey in tech started with a mix of dreams and a truckload of NPM errors.

Location: Currently setting up camp in Indore, where even the pigeons are tech-savvy (they use GPS for those impressive flybys! üê¶)
Work Palette: I've dabbled in the realms of MERN, AWS, and Azure‚Äîtaming the cloud while juggling Docker and Kubernetes. If you hear someone talking to servers, that's probably me negotiating for more uptime!
Joke #1: Why did the developer go broke? Because he used up all his cache! üí∏

Experience: A 2.3-year expedition in the tech wilderness, wandering through 16 live projects. If bugs were pesos, I'd be a millionaire by now!
Joke #2: Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn‚Äôt know how to 'null' his feelings. üò¢

Methodology: Agile Scrum is my jam‚Äîturning chaos into a choreographed dance of user stories and sprints. It's like conducting an orchestra, but with code!
Communication: I'm fluent in geek and human languages alike, but ironically, I'm the introverted tech wizard. If social skills were a code, I'd be debugging them constantly!
Hobbies: When I'm not debugging the world, you can catch me binging on anime, contemplating life's mysteries in Dragon Ball Z, or passionately discussing the offside rule in football.
Joke #3: How do programmers celebrate Halloween? By dressing up as "null"!
